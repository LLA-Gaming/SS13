		<li class='rscadd'>An abundance of highly necessary Perseus modifications: items such as Commander fatigues and Perc oxytanks have been readded, with slight modifications to their vending machine. </li>
		<li class='tweak'>Movement speed has been reverted back to the slightly slower state it was in due to a wealth of complaints regarding moving at the speed of sound.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Click speed has also been raised somewhat. Interaction with things via clicking should be a bit swifter in general -- not quite the immediate reaction it was, but far more tolerable than needing to double click to do anything.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Minor bug fixes regarding announcements.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Readded offline banning to enable administrators to catch those pesky loggers more easily!</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed the admin prison and unprison verbs as actual chunks of code were missing that made them both utterly redundant.</li>

	<h3 class='author'>Gun Hog updated:</h3>
	<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
		<li class='rscadd'>Nanotrasen programmers have discovered a potential exploit involving a station's door control networks. With sufficient computing power, the network can be overloaded and forced to open or bolt closed every airlock at once.</li>
		<li class='experiment'>Some reports suggest that the latest firmware update to Artifical Intelligence units installed in our research stations may contain this exploit. Any such reports that state that should a station's AI unit "malfunction", it may gain the ability to use this exploit to initate a full lockdown of the station. Fire locks and blast doors are also said to be affected.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Nanotrasen officially holds no validity to these reports. We recommend that station personnel disregard such rumors.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3 class='author'>Kelenius updated:</h3>
	<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
		<li class='rscadd'>After the years of extensive research into xenobiology, and thousands of scientists lost to the slimes, we have finally come to admitting that we don't have a clue how they work. However, we've outlined a few facts, and managed to breed a new kind of slimes. They will be shipped to your station on the next shifts. They are different from the ones they are used to in the following:</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Their sight is better than ever, and now they can finally see things that are not directly pressed against them. Beware, they may appear more aggressive!</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Their memory has also become better, and they will now remember the people who fed them. As a note, you need to grab the monkey or push it to show to the slime that you're giving it to them, and it's not just walking in.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Apparently, not only we have studied them, but they have also studied us. Slimes are now capable of showing various emotions, mimicking humans. Use it to your advantage.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>There are reports of slimes showing signs of sentience. Further research is recommended.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>One of the reported signs is their speech capability. Following facts have been gathered: they talk more often to those who feed them; they react to being called by the number, but 'slimes' is also acceptable; they are able to understand being ordered to "follow" someone, or "stop". There is a report of slime releasing the assistant after a scientist shouted at it, and then calmly ordered a slime to stop.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>We've made a modification of a health scanner that is intended for the use on slimes. Two are available in the smartfridge.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>We've come to a conclusion that 5 units of reagents are not necessary to cause slime core reactions. You actually only need one unit.</li>

	<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
		<li class='rscadd'>Thanks to Nanotrasen's Engineering division, the power wiring of the station has a received a complete overhaul. Here are the highlight features in CentCom report : </li>
		<li class='tweak'>Improved way of connecting cables! Finished is the time of "laying and praying" : it's now as simple as matching ends of each cables! </li>
		<li class='tweak'>Unified way of connecting machines! Every machine is connected to a powernet through a node cable (it still needs to be anchored to receive power though)!</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Lots of improvements in the cable cutting tools! Gone is the odd magic of physically separated yet still connected powernets (contact CentCom Engineering Division if you still witness something weird, we always have a fired form ready for our engineers!)!</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Any conscientious (or not!) Station Engineer may check an "updated wiring manual" at http://www.tgstation13.org/wiki/Wiring#Power_Wires</li>

	<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
		<li class='rscadd'>In an effort to increase information security, Nanotrasen has moved away from digital information systems in matters requiring maintaining corporate secrecy.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Station administrators are ordered to store all sensitive information in paper document form within their Station Vaults. Unauthorized distribution of these documents is punishable by death.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>NT Corporate Security has noticed a similar trend within the Syndicate. It is predicted that enemy agents will attempt to secretly exchange sensitive information in person within Nanotrasen Space. NT Security has posted a generous reward for any stations that are able to capture enemy intelligence and send them to Centcom via supply shuttle.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3 class='author'>Ikarrus updated:</h3>
	<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
		<li class='rscadd'>A recent breakthrough in Plasma Materials Research has led to the development of a stronger, tougher plasteel alloy that can better resist extreme heat by up to four times. A live demonstration preformed during a press conference earlier today showed a segment of reinforced wall resisting an attack by Thermite. The corporation also announces that upgrades to its existing stations is already underway.</li>

	<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
		<li class='rscadd'>Certain Enemies of the Corporation have discovered a critical exploit in the firmware of several NanoTrasen robots that could prevent the safe shutdown of units corrupted by illegally modified ID cards, dubbed "cryptographic sequencers".</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>NanoTrasen requires more research into this exploit, this we have issued a patch for AI and Cyborg software to simulate this malfunction. All NanoTrasen AI units are advised to only allow testing in a safe and contained environment. The robot can safely be reset at any time.</li>
		<li class='experiment'>Unfortunately, a robot corrupted by a "cryptographic sequencer" still cannot be reset by any means. NanoTrasen urges regular maintenance and care of all robots to reduce replacement costs.</li>

		<li class='experiment'><b>Sacrifice Cult - Cult has received a massive overhaul to how it works, focusing more on cult magics and sacrificing unbelievers. The most important changes are:</b></li>
		<li class='tweak'>Cult starts off with alot more cultists, 6 cultists below 30 players and 9 above. The HoP can no longer be a round start cultist but is still convertible.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Cultists start off with join, blood, self, and hell. These give the runes for the sacrifice and convert.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Conversions now require three cultists and converts no longer reward words, words must be obtained via sacrifice</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Sacrificing players traps their soul in a soul stone, which can then be used on construct shells to implant the souls in them</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Constructs shells can be summoned via a new rune (travel, hell, technology)</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>You can no longer convert the sacrifice target, you dozzy sods</li>
		<li class='experiment'>Summoning Narsie when she is not an objective leads to !!FUN!!</li>
		<li class='wip'>Wrote a system to allow all mob types to be sacrificable - currently only corgis are in the new system</li>
		<li class='experiment'>Holy Water will DECONVERT cultists, takes around 35 units and two minutes to succeed</li>
		<li class='experiment'>Hitting a mob that contains holy water with a tome will convert that water to unholy water, conversely hitting any container that contains unholy water with a bible as chaplain will 'cleanse' the taint.</li>
		<li class='experiment'>Unholy water works like a combination synaptazine and hyperzine, with a twist of branes dimarge and highly toxic to non-cultists</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Cargo can order a religious supplies crate - it contains flasks of holy water, candles, bibles, and robes </li>
		<li class='experiment'>Cultists have an innate ability to communicate to the cult hive mind (BE AWARE - THIS DOES A LOT OF DAMAGE), cultists can also communicate via the new Commune option on their tomes (the Read Tome option has been shifted under the Notes option)</li>

		<li class='rscadd'>Mining has been significantly overhauled. Hostile alien life has infested the western asteroid! Miners are given an equipment voucher to obtain equipment to protect themselves. There is a spare voucher in the HoP's office, should someone want to switch to mining mid-shift.</li>

Insert your ID to claim points, then spend them on goods at Mining Equipment Lockers. You require specific accesses to tell the Ore Redemption Machine to unload its sheets.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Should you not care for being eaten alive by horrible alien life, it is suggested you stick to the eastern asteroid, where there is no hostile alien life... though the yield on ore is not as good.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Most ore is no longer visible to the naked eye. You must ping it with a Mining Scanner (Available in all mining lockers) to locate nearby ore. Make sure to equip your mesons first, or it won't be visible.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Mesons no longer remove the darkness overlay, you must properly light your environment. Hull breaches to space can still be clearly seen, and it will still protect you from the singulo.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Mineral spawn rates have been significantly tweaked to cut down on unnecessary inflation of mineral economy.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>The asteroid no longer has ambient power on the entire asteroid. AI's who go onto asteroid turf will slowly die of power loss. Mining outposts are unaffected.</li>

                <li class='rscadd'>Constructable machines now depend on R&D parts!</li>
                <li class='rscadd'>DNA scanner: Laser quality lessens irradiation. Manipulator quality drastically improves precision (9x for best part) and scanner quality allows you to scan suicides/ling husks, with the best part enabling the cloner's autoprocess button, making it scan people in the scanner automatically.</li>
                <li class='rscadd'>Clone pod: Manipulator quality improves the speed of cloning. Scanning module quality affects with how much health people will be ejected, will they get negative mutation/no mutations/clean of all mutations/random good mutation, at best quality will enable clone console's autoprocess button and will try to clone all the dead people in records automatically, together with best DNA scanner parts cloning console will be able to work in full automatic regime autoscanning people and autocloning them.</li>
                <li class='rscadd'>Borg recharger: Capacitors' quality and powercell max charge affect the speed at which borgs recharge. Manipulator quality allows borg to be slowly repaired while inside the recharges, best manipulator allows even fire damage to be slowly repaired.</li>
                <li class='rscadd'>Portable power generators: Capacitors' quality produce more power. Better lasers consume less fuel and reduce heat production PACMAN with best parts can keep whole station powered with about sheet of plamsa per minute (approximately, wasn't potent enough to test).</li>
                <li class='rscadd'>Autolathe: Better manipulator reduces the production time and lowers the cost of things(they will also have less m_amt and g_amt to prevent production of infinity metal), stacks' cant be reduced in cost, because thatll make production of infinity metal/glass easy</li>
                <li class='rscadd'>Protolathe: Manipulators quality affects the cost of things(they will also have less m_amt and g_amt to prevent production of infinity metal), best manipulators reduces the cost 5 times (!)</li>
                <li class='rscadd'>Circuit imprinter: Manipulator quality affects the cost, best manipulator reduce cost(acid insluded) 4 times, i.e. 20 boards per 100 units of acid</li>
                <li class='rscadd'>Destructive analyzer: Better parts allow items with less reliability in. Redone how reliability is handled, you now see item reliability in the deconstruction menu and deconstructing items that has same or one point less research type level will rise the reliability of all known designs that has one or more research type requirements as the deconstructed item. Designs of the same type raise in reliability more. Critically broken things rise reliability of the design drastically. Whole reliability system is not used a lot but now at least on the R&D part it finally matters. </li>

Injectors now also consider where you aim, if you aim for the head it will try to use it through the head slot, otherwise it will aim for the body. To clarify, if you are wearing a space helmet and a doctor tries to inject you while aiming at your head, it will protect you until they aim for the unprotected body; same story for wearing a space suit and not a helmet.</li>

		Unstable anomalies have been spotted in your region of space. These anomalies can be hazardous and destructive, though our initial encounters with these space oddities has discovered a method of neutralization. Method follows.<br>
		<p>Step 1. Upon confirmation of an anomaly sighting, report its location. Early detection is key.<br>
		Step 2. Using an atmospheric analyzer at short range, determine the frequency that the anomaly's core is fluctuating at.</br>
		Step 3. Send a signal through the frequency using a radio signaller. Note that non-specialized signaller devices may possibly lack the frequency range needed.<br></p>
		With the anomaly neutralized and the station brought out of danger, inspect the area for any remnants of the anomaly. Properly researched, we believe these events could provide vast amounts of valuable data.<br>
