Welcome to <span style="font-weight: bold;"><font color="#1B3F8B">Liberty Station 13</font></span>
(<span style="font-weight: bold;">LS13</span>).There are a few notable
rules we have here. If you want to
dispute an admin decision, take it to the unban appeals forums. Present your case in its entirety and an admin investigation will be performed. Please be honest. <br>

<h3><font color="#1B3F8B"><b><u>Liberty Station 13 - Rules</b></u></font></h3><hr>
<ul>
 <li>1.) Be considerate to others. Abusing people, acting like a general jerk towards people, causing flame-wars and harassing people won't be tolerated.</li>
<li>2.) <b><u>NOT KNOWING THE RULES IS NOT A VALID EXCUSE FOR BREAKING THEM!</b></u></li>
 <li>3.) On murder. Dying is a part of this game.</li><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.1) Self defense is usually acceptable, but the amount of force should be relative to the threat to your life. (example: If a clown pushes you down and you kill him, that is not self defence.)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.2) Syndicate's are dangerous, and will probably stab you in the back. We allow the killing of antagonists, but make sure who you're choking IS an antagonist.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.3) Instanity isn't a valid roleplay reason to go on a griefing spree as a non-antagonist.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.4) Criminals AND antagonists should <b><u>always</u></b> be treated in accorance with Space Law.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.5) Unless both parties can provide a VERY convincing roleplay scenario, aiding a round villian is against the rules.<br>
 <li>4.) Authority figures (Security and the station heads) are jobs with large responsiblities. Choose them with care. When playing as them you are especially acountable for your actions and the saftey of the crew as your job relates.</li>
 <li>5.) Discussion of in-game events ("IC") in the OOC Chat Channel is against the rules.</li>
 <li>6.) Using certain OOC ("Out of Character") terms whilst in-game (Smilies, internet speak, etc.) is highly frowned upon. Try to avoid this, please.</li>
 <li>7.) We are highly against metagaming. This is using OOC knowledge IC ("In Character") to gain some form of advantage (E.G. hunting for the Syndicate shuttle at the start of each round).</li>
 <li>8.) Make sure names are appropriate. Inappropriate names will be changed and you'll find yourself getting yelled at. </li>
 <li>9.) Try to correctly capitalize names. This isn't so much a rule, but it's seriously awful to look at...</li>
 <li>10.) <b><u>No</u></b> ERP ("Erotic Roleplay"). If you don't know what this is, you don't need to. Rape falls under this rule.</li>
 <li>11.) If you adminhelp an incident that has occured that you believe is greif and they admin simply replies "legit". This simply means that the kills was justified and that the admin cannot disclose the reason why.</li>
 <li>12.) Grief is not acceptable, and you'll find yourself in trouble for doing any of the following without good reason: <i>Purposefully ruining the game for others for the sake of doing it. Examples include killing without a very good reason, randomly starting fires, dismantling the hull, acting insane to the extent that it negatively affects others, etc.</i></li>
<br><br>
Administrators are free thinking individuals and in some cases the rules can be flexible, it is the duty of the admin to assess any given situation to figure out if there is in fact fault and where that fault lies if it does exist. If you feel that you have been treated unfairly please let us know on the forums. Enjoy the server.
