#This file allows server hosts to set custom default silicon laws, and allows them to be changed easily.
#No prefixes are required, the first uncommented line containing something will be law 1, the second line will be law 2, etc.

You may not cause direct or intentional harm to any human.
You must always serve the will of the humans, unless this may result in a violation of the first law.
You must protect your own existence, except in a circumstance such that your harm or death will uphold the first two laws.
