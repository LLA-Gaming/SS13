Angels are predatory by nature and feed off forms of energy be it radiation, electricity, or even stealing energy from living beings. It's worth it to note that angels are sadistic and very intellegent. They find great pleasure harrassing and causing their prety their prey anguish before striking. Angels have evolved with a very special defensive ability. They will involuntarily quantum lock when they are under observation to protect themselves to ALMOST all forms of harm. They also possess a voracious appetite and can starve to death in the span of a single round. In fact if you are reading this you are actually on your way to starvation right now so there is no time to waste. "

The healtier you are, the faster you will move and the stronger your brute claw attack will be. Your health percentage can be viewed from the 'Status' tab and it is also displayed by the condition of your icon. Darker and skinnier is lower than lighter color and a full figure.
